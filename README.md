# MPL Solutions

In this repo I will be uploading solutions for exercises in the book Modern Programming Languages by Adam Brooks Webber. These solutions constitute my personal endeavor to familiarise myself with SML (and soon Prolog will be uploaded). Furthermore, I hope they help anyone else wanting to learn those languages.

## Index
* Each file corresponds to a chapter in the book, for instance book5.sml corresponds to chapter 5.
* Over time I will be uploading a total of 7 files (4 files for each ML chapter and 3 for each Prolog chapter)
